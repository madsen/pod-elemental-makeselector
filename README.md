Pod::Elemental::MakeSelector
============================

Pod::Elemental::MakeSelector is a Perl module that provides an alternative to [Pod::Elemental::Selectors](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Pod::Elemental::Selectors).  It allows more complex criteria to be expressed by a single selector, including criteria that Pod::Elemental::Selectors doesn't currently handle.


This is a Git repository where development of Pod-Elemental-MakeSelector takes place.  For more information, visit [Pod-Elemental-MakeSelector on CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Pod-Elemental-MakeSelector/).
